# RecipeQuest
As the person responsible for "What's for dinner?", I get tired of cooking and eating the same things all the time.
While there are probably hundreds of recipe websites out there containing thousands of recipes, it can sometimes take hours trying to pick one. This is a very simple, straight forward Web app that uses a public API containing unique recipes from around the world. This is the place to find something different.

Recipe Quest will allow anyone to search, by a category, i.e., Beef, Chicken, Dessert, or by area(country of origin) for recipes on a public API. The user must register/sign-in in order to view, add or delete a recipe to or from their "favorites" located in a MySql database.
